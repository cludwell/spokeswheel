#2025

4/1/2025
🔲Need to ensure that new conference is seeded
✅ will need to update the update registration page as well
--🔲 updated but will need to test


=================
🔲In the future might want to create a form for the admin so that new conferences can be created without losing the database
🔲worried about success message displaying correctly when redirected from stripe

3/30/2025
✅ Carousels have been fixed
--✅ Swippable/Draggable bug was fixed
✅ Page created for upcoming conference
✅ Update Stripe Payments and add items for children and adults
✅ Add payment links to registration form
✅ Update registration form
--✅ amenities
--✅ child or adult
--✅ prices
--✅ conditionally sends stripe link based on age

On reflection having a cart on stripe might be really annoying to program and debug, should probably keep system where each person registers for themselves just to deploy quickly.

Dropdown menu for different conferences
Create a page with info about our first conference
-image carousels
-interactive cards/media
-video
--host or compress video?
✅Create new page with tentative information about upcoming conference

Refactor registration page for 2025
-allow users to register multiple people at once

something 3d on the landing page?
Carousel is becoming a roadblock
-use Daisy component and learn how to build it someother time?

-three images in horizontal scroll bar
-clicking left and right slides image bar
-clicking image opens it in a modal to focus on it

-problem is responsiveness for mobile devices
-can use daisy component but all my pictures are portrait so it might look weird, especially on small media queries

-fastest solution is to use daisy
-can still try implementing focus modal
--use limits to height and width
shameless line so i can commit
another shameless line
#2024
✅ Get Prisma installed
✅Try using Next font imports from google
✅ Splash page

✅ Daisy UI is installed and working
✅ Got themes working as expected
✅ Figured out Next.js 14 routing system
✅ Got started on the router
✅ Got google fonts working as expected
✅ Got general header laid out
✅ Layout is now working with content between header and footer
✅ Debugged modals working with Next.js
-SSR creates different behavior of mounting unmounting createPortals, meaning animations were not firing
✅ Setting up Prisma
✅ Seeding the database
What was the problem? Why weren't the seedings working?
-Inconsistent pluralization of relationship assignments
-trying to connect before instances were created
Lesson: Leave assignment of connections until the end

🔲 Backend Routes
--✅User CRUD and forms C✅R✅U✅D✅
--✅Booking CRUD and forms C✅R✅U✅D✅
--🔲Conference CRUD and forms => would be for the admin, not a high priority
✅ Copy and paste Next/Auth functionality
✅ Tested and<<>> working
✅ Registration Form (Form only, not connected to state or db)
✅ Login Form
✅ Signup Form TESTED AND WORKING
✅ Create context to hold relevant data, user and user's bookings
✅ Deploy Zustand and have it accessible in context
✅ On successful login, have dispatch sent to store user and booking in store

✅Drop down menu
