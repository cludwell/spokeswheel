#2025

4/1/2025
ðŸ”²Need to ensure that new conference is seeded
âœ… will need to update the update registration page as well
--ðŸ”² updated but will need to test


=================
ðŸ”²In the future might want to create a form for the admin so that new conferences can be created without losing the database
ðŸ”²worried about success message displaying correctly when redirected from stripe

3/30/2025
âœ… Carousels have been fixed
--âœ… Swippable/Draggable bug was fixed
âœ… Page created for upcoming conference
âœ… Update Stripe Payments and add items for children and adults
âœ… Add payment links to registration form
âœ… Update registration form
--âœ… amenities
--âœ… child or adult
--âœ… prices
--âœ… conditionally sends stripe link based on age

On reflection having a cart on stripe might be really annoying to program and debug, should probably keep system where each person registers for themselves just to deploy quickly.

Dropdown menu for different conferences
Create a page with info about our first conference
-image carousels
-interactive cards/media
-video
--host or compress video?
âœ…Create new page with tentative information about upcoming conference

Refactor registration page for 2025
-allow users to register multiple people at once

something 3d on the landing page?
Carousel is becoming a roadblock
-use Daisy component and learn how to build it someother time?

-three images in horizontal scroll bar
-clicking left and right slides image bar
-clicking image opens it in a modal to focus on it

-problem is responsiveness for mobile devices
-can use daisy component but all my pictures are portrait so it might look weird, especially on small media queries

-fastest solution is to use daisy
-can still try implementing focus modal
--use limits to height and width
shameless line so i can commit
another shameless line
#2024
âœ… Get Prisma installed
âœ…Try using Next font imports from google
âœ… Splash page

âœ… Daisy UI is installed and working
âœ… Got themes working as expected
âœ… Figured out Next.js 14 routing system
âœ… Got started on the router
âœ… Got google fonts working as expected
âœ… Got general header laid out
âœ… Layout is now working with content between header and footer
âœ… Debugged modals working with Next.js
-SSR creates different behavior of mounting unmounting createPortals, meaning animations were not firing
âœ… Setting up Prisma
âœ… Seeding the database
What was the problem? Why weren't the seedings working?
-Inconsistent pluralization of relationship assignments
-trying to connect before instances were created
Lesson: Leave assignment of connections until the end

ðŸ”² Backend Routes
--âœ…User CRUD and forms Câœ…Râœ…Uâœ…Dâœ…
--âœ…Booking CRUD and forms Câœ…Râœ…Uâœ…Dâœ…
--ðŸ”²Conference CRUD and forms => would be for the admin, not a high priority
âœ… Copy and paste Next/Auth functionality
âœ… Tested and<<>> working
âœ… Registration Form (Form only, not connected to state or db)
âœ… Login Form
âœ… Signup Form TESTED AND WORKING
âœ… Create context to hold relevant data, user and user's bookings
âœ… Deploy Zustand and have it accessible in context
âœ… On successful login, have dispatch sent to store user and booking in store

âœ…Drop down menu
âœ…-update user info
âœ…-update booking
âœ…-delete booking
âœ…-create booking

âœ… When user signs out, user is removed from state
secret page for admin to see all bookings

âœ… Make error handling for frontend and backend if user password doesnt match database

âœ… Create $.25 test payment link for active Stripe
âœ… Merge Stripe payments to main
âœ… General testing
    -made sure that registration link is not in header if registered
    -drop down responsive to registration status
    -tested log in error handling redirect
âœ… DOB working on user update
âœ… Correct pricing on Registration and Reg Update
âœ… On Reg Update, will want conditional send to Stripe if user has not paid yet
âœ… Theres currently a problem updating state after a booking has been deleted
âœ… Error handling is not happening on registration creation and backend fetch is being sent
âœ… We're ready for production!
âœ… Copy payment links in Stripe to production mode
âœ… Create a test payment link for .25 cents to make sure stripe is working in production
âœ… Update redirection from Stripe to my app's url
âœ… Remember to handle secret keys
âœ… Paid status is not being updated via the webhook, probably secret key related
ðŸ”² If user has paid they are unable to change lodging on registration update

this command will be used to update frontend without effecting database
npm run deploy

this command will be used to wipe database
npm install && npm run setup && npm run build
