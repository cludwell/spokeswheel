      >{`We are a group of radicals and leftists who come out of Unitarian Universalist (UU) or UU adjacent spaces and conferences. Disillusioned by that community, which seemed like virtue signaling without principal, we as adults have struggled to find spiritual spaces that do not bear the authoritarianism of organized religion, or the appropriation, spiritual by-passing, and apolitical nature of what passes as "spirituality." You won't hear us saying corny shit like "low vibration frequency" ðŸ¤¨. What the heck even is that?`}</p>

      <p className=" my-8">{`This community is what we make of it. As this will be our first conference, we're still imagining what this could be. We've floated ideas of traveling the country together, going on a backpacking trip through a national park to an isolated hot spring, or staying in a haunted hotel on an isolated island. Everything here is a living document open to change with your participation. The general structure to expect is: `}</p>
