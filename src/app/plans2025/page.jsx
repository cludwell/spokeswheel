        {`BIG NEWS! We've finally reserved a camp! We'll be staying at the Camp Farnsworth Girl Scout Camp in Thetford, Vermont! It's a little further from most of us in the Boston Metro area, but we think the facilities will be a great fit for us! We will be renting their dining hall which can accomodate up to 200 people as well as the Tovariche Cabins, if you're familiar with the site.`}

      <p className="my-8 fade-in">{`Each cabin can accomodate 2-8 people, and have cots with mattresses. This is a girl scout camp, and not an AirBnb, so think of it as glamping! We recommend you think about bringing: `}</p>

        <li>A sleeping bag, as there will NOT be bedding 💤</li>

        </li>
        <li>A towel and shower kit 🚿</li>
        <li>
          If you'd like more privacy, bring a tent/tarp for dispersed camping.🏕

        <li>Art supplies! 🎨</li>
        <li>Musical instruments 🎸</li>
